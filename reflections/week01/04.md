## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wire-framing allows for quick or cheap mockups of design which can be easily iterated on or changed.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

The three levels of wire-framing are: low-, mid-, and high-fidelity wire-frames. Low-fidelity wire-frames are useful for their ease of creation, and getting an idea of how a design will look overall. Mid-fidelity wire-frames are useful to start getting an idea of how design elements will work together, and how the flow of a design will function. High-fidelity wire-frames are useful to nail down how you want the final design to come together.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I think that they are worth it because it's a lot easier to not get stuck on design descisions mid-coding when the descisions have already been made.
