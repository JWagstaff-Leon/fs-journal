## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

The idea that stood out the most to me was creating a visual hirearchy to allow users to quickly and subconsciously intuit functions of a website.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

Any large company's website such as google.com or amazon.com will provide good examples of good design. Sites like color.adobe.com or frameworks like bootstrap can provide ideas for cohesive color pallets.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Good design allows users to adjust to a new website easier, and allows them to accomplish their desired goal on that website with less roadblocks.
