# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This week I learned how useful blocking out a site beforehand can be. Having an overview of what else needs to be done not only allows the design of a website to be consistent, but also allows for an easy shift of focus if you're stuck on a different part.
Learning how bootstrap's different responsiveness features work was interesting, and any time I tried something new in bootstrap, the mobile responsive features were great with how simple they were to implement.
Adjusting to the mobile-first design of bootstrap, where you target the smallest screens first, has been tough, but I'm getting used to it.
Overall this week was a little bit of a learning curve, but satisfying to get accustomed to.
