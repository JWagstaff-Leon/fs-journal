## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A CSS pseudo-class is a type of selector that is based on the state of the element; common ones include :hover, :before, and after.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is a value given to a CSS rule that determines how a rule will overwrite another in the case of a conflict. It is used to overwrite styling on elements that need more specific styling than similar elements on the page.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Overusing !important can cause future styling to become difficult as the addition of !important could be forgotten, leading to a situation where it is unclear why a rule isn't applying. It can also lead to messy or vague styling practices where everything is infinitely specific.
