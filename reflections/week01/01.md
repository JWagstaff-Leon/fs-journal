## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

git is used to streamline development, especially across teams; providing a means for every member of a team to work on a project without conflicting with any other member's work. Source control allows for easy documentation of changes, including who made them and what was removed.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Multiple branches expands from just allowing developers to develop towards a single version, to allowing multiple versions â€” often test versions â€” of a project to be developed in parallel. Branches also allow for easy merging back into the main version once a branch is deemed complete.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

git is the underlying technology for version control; GitHub is a third-party site designed to host repositories made with git.
