## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An enum is a type that handles converting collections of related-but-distinct numbers in your code to a symbol, as well as adding in strongly-typed benefits (one enum is not another.)

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You can modify an instance of an enum by setting it equal to a symbol of the enum type that is is, or by parsing a valid value that corresponds to a symbol of that enum type with Enum.Parse;

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I haven't yet; but they seem useful if you needed to keep track of user options or app states that have many possibilites and need to be checked often.
