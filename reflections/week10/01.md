## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value - stores their data in a single location; can be passed as an argument without being mutated.
Reference - stores a memory location of where their data is stored; could be mutated if passed as an argument.
Pointer - stores a memory location to a value data type; the pointer will not be changed if passed as an argument, but the data it points to could.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

Value type data types store their data in a single memory location; in C# they are strongly-typed instead of weakly-typed.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference type data types store a memory location to a where their data is stored, as opposed to value type data types which store their data in a single memory location. This means that reference data types will not neccessarily bu unchanged if passed as an argument to a function, while value types won't be.
