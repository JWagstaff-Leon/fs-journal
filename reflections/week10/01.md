## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

Value type data types store their data in a single memory location; in C# they are strongly-typed instead of weakly-typed.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference type data types store a memory location to a where their data is stored, as opposed to value type data types which store their data in a single memory location.
