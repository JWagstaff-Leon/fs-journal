## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing â€” testing individual units of code
Component testing â€” testing individual components
End-to-end testing â€” testing the entire application from the persepctive of a user

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

Unit testing seems the most useful, as it attempts to detect and fix problems before they go unnoticed.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Component testing seems the least useful, as unit testing and end-to-end seem to provide slightly more comprehensive testing coverage than component testing.
