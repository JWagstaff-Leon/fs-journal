## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

It allows expectations to be easily set based on real time updates, and removes the need for meetings to clear up spaces where communication wasn't happening.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

People need to be more flexible in what work they do, and expectations need to be set based on the fact that the team is smaller.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The attainable triangle describes tradeoffs that have to be made when deadlines are too close. The tradeoffs are the cheaper a solution is, it will be slower or worse. If you want it to be good, it will have to be slow or expensive.
