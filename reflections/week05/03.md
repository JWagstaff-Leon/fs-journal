## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Planning in advance how much time you'll spend on a task, then sticking to that time frame.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

* Try to give myself breaks instead of working straight through until something is done.
* Starting with the hardest thing first.
* Keeping up with the timeboxing that the codeworks curriculum lends itself to. 

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how?

At one of my old jobs, I'd often put tasks off if it wasn't completely optimal to do them then, and I often had a hard time getting around to them on time.
