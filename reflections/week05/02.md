## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

* 1-to-1: every item from a collection relates to 1 and only 1 item from another collection in both directions.
* 1-to-Many: every item from one collection relates to exactly 1 item in another collection in which each item can relate to any number of items.
* Many-to-Many: every item from a collection can relate to any number of items in another collection in which each item can relate to any number of items.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

Linking can help pagination and prevent the "1" item of a relationship from growing.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

If one or both collections are very large, trying to query for adding, calulating, or deleting links can be very slow if you use One or Two way embedding.
