## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

+ declaring a function `function <functionName> (<parameters>) { ... }`
+ function expression ` ... = function(<parameters>) { ... };`
+ lambda expression ` ... (<paremters>) => { ... };`

Function declarations are hoisted, function expressions are not hoisted, and lambda expressions are only valid on the line they're on.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are the declarations of the variables in the function, arguments are the actual values passed into a function.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Any function that takes in or returns a function.
