## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

The area of code in which a variable is validly declared; declaring a variable twice in the same scope can lead to malfunctioning code.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is the interpreter moving a variable declaration up to the top of the variable's scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

You would use let for general cases where you need the data in the variable to change.
You would use const in cases where you need to be able to change something pre-run time (a hard coded value that can be referenced as many times as needed elsewhere.)
You would use var if you want to have a bad time.
