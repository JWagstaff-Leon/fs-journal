## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

An image that has been convetred into a text string to be inserted into an html or css file.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

It takes extra time to encode and decode the image; the image also cannot be cached, and search engines cannot link back to your site from the image as easily.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

Previously http didn't allow multiplexing, so allowing images to come in all at once could speed up image-heavy websites.
