## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are using vue and javascript; we plan to try to implement electron.

2. What went well so far?

We are all on the same page and have kept in line with the product owner.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

Planned better and kept the scope smaller to begin with. We lost focus trying to expand for a while, and now are trying to pull it all together before Friday.
