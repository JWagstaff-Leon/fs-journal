> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

Keeping track of updating one-to-many data relationships

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

subscribe - register to an event
unsubscribe - unregister to an event
broadcast - inform all subscribers of an update

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

By subscribing to events driven by data writes, the corresponding parts of the dom can be updated when the relevant data changes.
