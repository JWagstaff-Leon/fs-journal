## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

Adding many script tags to your html.

2. How does export differ from export default?

"export" exports something explicitly, and is so only imported if asked for; "export default" exports something implicitly, and will be imported if nothing is specifically requested. 

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Easier code reuse, easier debugging, more controlled code flow potential.
