## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

To prevent users from implementing around things that may change in the future, and to control the flow of data.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

It relies on the users to avoid using, and is not enforced.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

Add a pound before the variable name; doing so will enforce encapsulation on the variable.
