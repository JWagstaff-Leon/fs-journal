## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is local to a table, and cannot be reapeated across 2 rows on that table; a foregin key is a reference on a table to a different table's primary key to create a relationship.

2. What is an `Alias`?

A shorthand way to reference a table; set by writing it out after the first time you access a table in a query.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

(assuming the first table is named doctor instead of doctors)

SELECT
p.*
FROM doctors ds
JOIN patients p ON ds.patientId = p.id
WHERE ds.id = *given ID*
