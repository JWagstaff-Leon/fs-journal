## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

It allows us to extend class while maintaining the same type of the parent class.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Child classes inherit all members except for constructor and destructor.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Private members cannot be seen by inheriting classes; internal are only visible if they're in the same compilation; protected and public are always visible in inheriting classes.
